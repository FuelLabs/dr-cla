Ecosystem Contribution Agreement

A. Your Open Source Software Contribution

This agreement is between you and the "Open Source Integrity Organization" identified below. The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that your software contributions (your "Contribution", which includes any submission or commit) are integrated into the open source software that you are contributing to, so that others may enjoy the software and make use of it in the way consistent with the applicable license found in the repository to which you contribute code to (each one a "Repository"), whether now, previously, or going forward.

B. Principles

This agreement is formed around 8 key principles, which are elaborated below in the Articles:

1. Our commitment to open source software
2. No obligation to contribute your code
3. Personal freedom to use your code
4. Integrity of open source software
5. No plagiarism
6. Protecting your contribution
7. Authorship credit
8. You will have no liability to us

C. Articles

1. Each Contribution to a Repository shall be licensed to everyone by way of the Open Source Integrity Organization according to the LICENSE file found in the Repository which sets out the applicable open source license (the "OSL"). The Open Source Integrity Organization shall endeavour to maintain the Repository publicly for all to use.
2. Entering into this agreement does not obligate you to write any code for any Repository. You may stop contributing at any time and are not required to write a single line of code that you do not want to. The freedom to contribute is also the freedom to withdraw from contributing.
3. Every Contribution shall be automatically licensed to you so that you may make use of your Contribution in other projects, including projects that are not open source software. The terms of the foregoing license are that you may make use of, distribute, modify your Contribution on a non-exclusive, non-revocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, and worldwide basis.
4. If you submit any code that is a part of another open source project (such as a library) and that code is not your original work, then that portion of what would otherwise be your Contribution shall not be considered a Contribution. You have the obligation to ensure that you only submit code that is compatible with the OSL for the Repository. Non-open source code (i.e. commercial software) cannot be mixed with the Repositoryâ€™s code because then the OSL will not be an accurate description of the open source licensing for the Repository.
5. You may not submit any code that is neither your original work nor open source-licensed (with a compatible license, as per Article 4 above), so that the integrity of the OSL and Repository is respected.
6. The Open Source Integrity Organization shall be the owner of your Contribution (by way of the assignment that this agreement embodies). Although the Open Source Integrity Organization shall do its best to ensure that the OSL is respected, it shall not be obligated to sue possible infringers. To the extent permitted in your jurisdiction, you waive any moral rights, so that others may make use of your contributions within the Repository or elsewhere, according to the OSL.
7. You will be credited under the username that you use to make a Contribution, within the Repository. The Open Source Integrity Organization shall not take any steps to obscure this authorship with respect to the Repository, but you acknowledge that it is possible that reorganizations of the code base may make contributions less obvious within the Repository.
8. Other than the above obligations, you will not have any liability to the Open Source Integrity Organization, to the extent lawfully permitted in your jurisdiction. There is no obligation for you to provide any support with respect to your Contribution and your Contribution is made to the Repository without any warranty at all, to the maximum extent permitted in your jurisdiction.

D. The Open Source Integrity Organization

"Fuel Labs Inc.", a corporation headquartered in the British Virgin Islands.

E. Right To Use This Agreement For Other Purposes

You may use this agreement for your own purposes provided you only modify the section titled "The Open Source Integrity Organization". If you change any other part of this agreement then you must give it a new title in order to distinguish it from this agreement, but other than this limitation, you are free to make use of this agreement however you would like.
